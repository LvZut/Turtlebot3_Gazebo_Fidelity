# Turtlebot3_Gazebo_Fidelity

This repository contains the files used for testing the Turtlebot3 Burger bot.
The tests consisted of:
Measuring LiDAR detection range
Measuring LiDAR noise at different distances
Measuring LiDAR intensity on different surfaces
Examining execution time when driving
Examining the effect of driving speed on trajectory
Measuring the turning angle using the gyroscope
