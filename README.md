# Turtlebot3_Gazebo_Fidelity

This repository contains the files used for testing the Turtlebot3 Burger bot.
The tests consisted of:
1. Measuring LiDAR detection range
2. Measuring LiDAR noise at different distances
3. Measuring LiDAR intensity on different surfaces
4. Examining execution time when driving
5. Examining the effect of driving speed on trajectory
6. Measuring the turning angle using the gyroscope
